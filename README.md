# 🚀 GeminiAI Image Analyzer - My First Generative AI Project

## 🌟 Project Overview

This is my first **Generative AI** project using **Google Gemini API**. The **GeminiAI Image Analyzer** allows users to upload images, and the AI generates a description of the content of the image. This project demonstrates my ability to integrate **Generative AI** models to create interactive applications.

The app uses **Streamlit** to provide a user-friendly interface, and Google's **Gemini** API to analyze and describe the uploaded images.

🎯 Skills Demonstrated
Generative AI: Hands-on experience with Google's Gemini API for natural language processing and image recognition.

Streamlit: Developed an intuitive web interface to interact with the AI model and display results.

Python: Proficient in Python for backend logic and integrating APIs.

API Integration: Experience in working with external APIs and managing API keys for secure integration.

## 🎯 Project Features

- **Upload Image**: Users can upload an image of any type (JPG, PNG, JPEG).
- **AI Image Description**: The AI model analyzes the image and generates a description of what’s in the image.
- **Dynamic UI**: Built with **Streamlit** to provide a smooth user experience.
- **Generative AI**: Leveraging Google's **Gemini API** for natural language generation and computer vision tasks.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used for the backend logic.
- **Streamlit**: A tool for building interactive web apps, used for the UI.
- **Google Gemini API**: For image analysis and text generation.
